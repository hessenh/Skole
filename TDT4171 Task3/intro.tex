\section{Introduction}
In this exercise we are supposed to create and document a simple Decision
Support System for an every day life problem. We will see how variables may
infere with each other, and how we can calculate an utility values based on
these variables and a given decision. I have chosen the problem of ``what to do
this evening?'', as I think this is a representative every day problem. This
problem includes your mood and other factors that tells about how you feel, a
set of possible actions to decide between, a set of consequences given the 
state and a decision plus a utility function that calculates how a decision is.
This assignment focuses on the modeling of the Decision Support System, and will
not contain much mathematics or formulas about probability.
