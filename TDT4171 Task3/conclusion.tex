\section{Conclusion}
To create a Decision Support System is no trivial task, though mapping it into
GeNIe is not that hard once I got the grip on it. I spent most of the time
on trying to understand the effect of the different values, as well as getting
the arcs right. I think that in order to create a very good Decision support
System, you have to spend a lot of time first thinking of what variables are
important, since adding too much just adds complexity without adding value,
second you have to tune all the values right. This is a task requiring very good
domain knowledge, and usually you would test the system against a panel of
experts.

All in all, Decision Support Systems may be a good tool in many situations, but
may also be flawed in that they simplify the world in ways that often introduce
errors. The best use is where we have a lot of hard data with deterministic, or
almost deterministic outcome. In such a situation, this kind of systems will
outperform any human.
